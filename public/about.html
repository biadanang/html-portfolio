<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello World! I'm a second-year student at Da Nang University of Technology and
  Science. I'm studying Chemical Engineering, but sometimes I find this field a
  bit boring and unsuitable, so my mood is really bad. I have a beloved cousin,
  her husband is a programmer, during the Tet holiday in Vietnam they came to
  visit relatives and my family was probably the fate that brought him to become
  a member. of our family.

<p>
  His nickname is Venture, the person who inspired me to learn programming and
  showed me ways to learn programming and showed me how to write good code when
  I was in Vietnam, you can say he is like an older brother. as well as a
  teacher who directed me to programming and thanks to that I also overcame
  boredom. So grateful to him.
</p>
<p>
  And my cousin is also a wonderful person, she also confides and shares with me
  when I have sadness that few people understand, perhaps because she has also
  experienced such feelings. It's great that I get to meet such people and
  luckily they are also my family. And they have a baby together. This is a baby
  boy who is about to be born and I can't wait to see his face. Thanks for
  reading about me.<br /><br />
  Today is July 7, 2024 at 00:25 a.m. I am studying programming and sharing a
  little about my thoughts right now.
